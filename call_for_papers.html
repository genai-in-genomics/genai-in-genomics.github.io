          <h2 id="submit">Submission Instructions</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>We will offer two submission tracks.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Regular Papers</h3>
          <p>
            Regular paper submissions may be up to <strong>8 pages</strong>, excluding Software and Data, References, and Appendix.
            Submissions that exceed this page limit will not be considered for review.
          </p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Tiny Papers</h3>
          <p>
            Tiny paper submissions may be up to <strong>4 pages</strong>, excluding Software and Data, References, and Appendix.
            Submissions that exceed this page limit will not be considered for review.
          </p>

          <p>In line with ICLR regulations, for this track we especially encourage submissions that present:</p>
          <ul class="tight-list">
            <li>An implementation and evaluation of an unpublished but simple idea</li>
            <li>A modest yet self-contained theoretical result</li>
            <li>A follow-up experiment or re-analysis of a previously published paper</li>
            <li>A fresh perspective on an existing publication</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Originality -->
        <div class="row" style="font-size:18px">
          <h2 id="originality">Originality of Submission</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Submitted work must be original and not previously published. Submissions that have appeared on preprint servers,
            such as arXiv, are permitted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Review -->
        <div class="row" style="font-size:18px">
          <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            The review process is double-blind. Please anonymize your submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For both tracks, authors may include an unlimited number of appendix pages after the bibliography.
            Reviewers are not required to read the appendix.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- LLM -->
        <div class="row" style="font-size:18px">
          <h2 id="llm">Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            In line with ICLR regulations, the use of large language models is permitted as a general-purpose assistance tool.
            However, if an LLM plays a significant role in research ideation and/or writing, such that it could reasonably be considered a contributor,
            authors must disclose its use. The specific role of the LLM should be described in a dedicated <strong>LLM Usage</strong> section,
            which may be included in the appendix and does not count toward the page limit. Failure to disclose significant LLM usage may result in desk rejection.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Tiny Paper track, in line with ICLR regulations, fully AI-generated papers are not permitted in this submission format.
            AI assistance is allowed, but submissions must be primarily human-authored and reflect original thought and analysis.
            Authors are encouraged to consult guidance from NYU and MIT regarding the distinction between AI-generated and AI-assisted work.
          </p>

          <hr>
          <p>
            All accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop. A subset of papers from the Regular Paper track will be selected
            for spotlight oral presentations based on reviewer feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the workshop is non-archival, authors of accepted papers will have the option to make their paper, poster, or presentation slides available
            through the workshop website and the Gen<sup>2</sup> OpenReview venue.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will encourage presenters of accepted submissions to attend the workshop in person, while accommodating virtual attendance in cases of visa issues
            or other exceptional circumstances. In such cases, we will coordinate in advance to collect pre-recorded presentations to broadcast during the event.

          <p><strong>What does “non-archival” mean?</strong></p>
          <p>
            This workshop is non-archival, meaning that accepted papers will not appear in official proceedings and will not preclude future submission
            of the same or extended work to archival conference or journal venues.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Can I submit the same work to another workshop?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Concurrent submission of the same or related work to other venues is permitted, subject to the policies of those venues.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Can I submit a work at the workshop that has already been accepted elsewhere?</strong></p>
          <p>
            As this workshop is non-archival, submissions of work that have been accepted but not yet formally published are permitted.
          </p>
        </div>
