            Gen<sup>2</sup> is designed to sharply focus on domain-specific roadblocks and open challenges that must be addressed to accelerate the impact of GenAI in genomics. We welcome submissions of unpublished work and works-in-progress on a range of topics at this intersection, as listed in the <strong>"Topics of Interest"</strong> section below.   
            </p>

          <p>
           We invite submissions through our <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/Gen2">OpenReview portal</a> in two tracks: 
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Workshop Papers</strong> (4-8 pages), and</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tiny Papers</strong> (2-4 pages),
            </li>
          </ul>
           latter of which is designed to encourage the communication of early findings and lower the barrier to entry for early-career researchers.<br>

           Both tracks are considered <strong>non-archival</strong> to avoid conflict with future publication. The review process is double-blind. We ask that authors strictly follow the LaTeX templates provided below and submit anonymized papers.<br>

           Please review the submission instructions on this page and reach out to <a href="mailto:genai-in-genomics@googlegroups.com">genai-in-genomics@googlegroups.com</a> if you have any questions.  
         </p>

          <div class="reciprocal-review-box">
            <p><strong>Reciprocal Review:</strong> To ensure a fair and high-quality review process, we require that each submission nominate at least one author to review up to 3 submissions between <strong>February 3 - 20</strong> via the submission page.</p>

            Regular paper submissions may be up to <strong>8 pages</strong>, excluding Software and Data, References, and Appendix.<br>
            Submissions that violate page limits or anonymization policies will be desk rejected.<br>

          <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Tiny Papers</h3>
          <p>
            Tiny paper submissions may be up to <strong>4 pages</strong>, excluding Software and Data, References, and Appendix. <br> 
            Submissions that violate page limits or anonymization policies will be desk rejected.<br>

          </p>

          <p>In line with ICLR regulations, for this track we especially encourage submissions that present:</p>
          <ul class="tight-list">
            <li>An implementation and evaluation of an unpublished but simple idea</li>
            <li>A modest yet self-contained theoretical result</li>
            <li>A follow-up experiment or re-analysis of a previously published paper</li>
            <li>A fresh perspective on an existing publication</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Originality -->
        <div class="row" style="font-size:18px">
          <h2 id="originality">Originality of Submission</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Submitted work must be original and not previously published. Submissions that have appeared on preprint servers, such as arXiv, or other non-archival workshops are permitted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Review -->

          <hr>
          <p>
            The review process is double-blind. Please ensure your submissions are anonymized.
          </p>
          <p>
            For both tracks, authors may include an unlimited number of appendix pages after the bibliography.
            However, please keep in mind that the reviewers are not required to read the appendix. Therefore, please try to communicate your core findings and their importance in the main text. 
          </p>

          <h2 id="llm">Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            In line with ICLR regulations, the use of large language models is permitted as a general-purpose assistance tool.
            However, if an LLM plays a significant role in research ideation and/or writing, such that it could reasonably be considered a contributor,
            authors must disclose its use. The specific role of the LLM should be described in a dedicated <strong>LLM Usage</strong> section,
            which may be included in the appendix and does not count toward the page limit. Failure to disclose significant LLM usage may result in desk rejection.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Tiny Paper track, in line with ICLR regulations, fully AI-generated papers are not permitted in this submission format.
            AI assistance is allowed, but submissions must be primarily human-authored and reflect original thought and analysis.
            Authors are encouraged to consult guidance from NYU and MIT regarding the distinction between AI-generated and AI-assisted work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Presentation -->

          <hr>
          <p>
            All accepted papers will be presented as posters during the workshop. A subset of papers from the Regular Paper track will be selected
            for spotlight oral presentations based on reviewer feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the workshop is non-archival, authors of accepted papers will have the option to make their paper, poster, or presentation slides available
            through the workshop website and <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/Gen2">the Gen<sup>2</sup> OpenReview venue.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will encourage presenters of accepted submissions to attend the workshop in person, while accommodating virtual attendance in cases of visa issues
            or other exceptional circumstances. In such cases, we will coordinate in advance to collect pre-recorded presentations to broadcast during the event.

          <hr>

          <p><strong>What does "non-archival" mean?</strong></p>
          <p>
            This workshop is non-archival, meaning that accepted papers will not appear in official proceedings and will not preclude future submission
            of the same or extended work to archival conference or journal venues.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Can I submit the same work to another workshop?</strong></p>
          <p>
            Yes, concurrent submission of the same or related work to other venues is permitted. However, please double-check the policies of any other venues to which you are submitting.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Can I submit a work at the workshop that has already been accepted elsewhere?</strong></p>
          <p>
            As this workshop is non-archival, submissions of work that have been accepted but not yet formally published are permitted.
